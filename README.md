# Personal Portfolio | Senior Software Engineer | Microfrontend Architecture | Next.js and Node.js

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my skills as a senior software engineer, featuring a blog section and an "about" page. I've used various technologies to create this project, including Next.js, Node.js, and a custom Express app. I've also utilized microfrontend architecture to make the site more modular and scalable.

## Technologies Used

Here are the main technologies I've used to create this project:

- **Next.js**: Next.js is a popular React framework for building static and server-side rendered applications. I chose Next.js for this project because it provides a great development experience and can easily scale to handle larger projects. It also comes with a built-in server that can handle server-side rendering of React components, which makes the site more SEO-friendly.

- **Node.js**: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. I used Node.js to create the custom Express app that powers the backend of the Next.js app. Node.js is known for its ability to handle high traffic and is often used for building scalable web applications.

- **Custom Express app**: I created a custom Express app to serve as the backend for the Next.js app. This backend provides the necessary APIs and data for the frontend to consume. Express.js is a popular framework for building web applications.

## Microfrontend Architecture

I used microfrontend architecture to make this site more modular and scalable. With microfrontend architecture, the site is split into multiple smaller apps or modules, each of which is responsible for a specific part of the site. This approach makes it easier to develop, test, and deploy each part of the site independently, which can save time and reduce the risk of errors.

## Next.js Backend

The backend of the Next.js app is powered by the custom Express app that I created. This app provides APIs that the frontend can use to fetch data and update the UI. One of the advantages of using Next.js is that it provides server-side rendering of React components, which can make the site more SEO-friendly. By rendering the pages on the server, search engines can crawl the content more easily and improve the site's visibility in search results.

## Custom Framework

I used object-oriented programming principles to create a custom framework for this project. The framework provides a consistent structure and interface for creating new modules, and it also includes common functionality that is used across the site, such as authentication and routing.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Start the development server by running `npm run start:all`
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
